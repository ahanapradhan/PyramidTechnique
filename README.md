main.py has the formulas of the pyramid technique: lemma 1 (intersection of a rectangle with a pyramid) and lemma 2 (interval intersection of a query with a pyramid)
comparison.py creates plots on the expected fraction of the page access, comparing the pyramid technique and balanced split-based technique (formula given just below Figure 3)
